    Turing is known for "The Entscheidungsproblem" which tried to prove that one 
system that could determine what mathmatical statements are proveable within a given formal mathmatical system and which are not, but they failed. The big long name thing has no proven resolution, and wouldnt be able to do what it was made for, however that lead to the abstact computing machine of the Turing Machine. He is also known for being the founding father of Artificial Intelligence.
